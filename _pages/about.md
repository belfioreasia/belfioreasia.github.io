I'm an Italian Computer Science Postgraduate Student living in London.
I am deeply interested in the fields of Data Science and AI, with particular regard to researching their applications in the Healthcare sector.
During my high school years, I took part in various Italian Competitions, ranging from Mathematics to Physics and Natural Sciences, reaching the National level Problem-Solving Italian Olympiads. These have pushed me to build teamwork and leadership skills and to learn how to perform to the best of my abilities, especially under pressure.

Education
======
After living in a small countryside town in central Italy for my entire life, I moved to London in 2021 to pursue my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Mathematics. The degree has allowed me to gain knowledge and skills in a wide variety of subjects, like Data Structures, Operating Systems and Deep Learning. At the same time, the joint nature of the degree enabled me to also explore more advanced topics in Mathematics.
I have worked as a Demonstrator for EECS modules at QMUL, overseeing and offering support to groups of first- and second-year students. The experience not only enabled me to solidify my communication and time management skills, but it allowed me to fully appreciate the importance of sharing knowledge in the Scientific Community.
I am now attending Imperial College London, undertaking my Masters studies in Advanced Computing.

Extracurriculars
======
I have occasionally worked on Front-End development and Design side projects, using tools like Figma and Canva alongside JavaScript, React and CSS to create and build web applications.
Alongside my studies, I have enrolled in a variety of Virtual work experiences and online courses on Machine Learning, Data Visualization and Software Engineering, and gained expertise even in topics outside the scope of my degree, including Nutrition and Bioinformatics.
