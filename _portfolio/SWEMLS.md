Many serious medical conditions can result in kidney injury, making kidney function a good, if lagging, indicator of general health.
Acute kidney injury is generally detected through the presence of creatine, a waste product, in the blood. If a patientâ€™s kidneys are damaged, they will not be able to remove creatinine effectively, leading to an increased amount being found in blood tests.

This is a proposed Machine Learning model for the prediction of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) from clinical temporal changes of creatinine levels.
Trained on 7000+ clinical samples, this ML model can correctly predict the presence of AKI with >98% accuracy.
