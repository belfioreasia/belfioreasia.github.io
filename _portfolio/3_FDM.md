**FDM Expenses Manager** is an expenses tracker system that is intended to be used by FDM employees to submit expense claims for various business charges, and receive a reimbursement equivalent to the capital expenditure. 
The current expenses system FDM implements is an inefficient and manual approach which, in such a fast-paced environment, results in a slowdown of their operations. This may not only lead to unnecessary costs, but to the extent of having the necessity to replace the current system due to its high inefficiency.

We propose a free software that will provide its users with the ability to submit reimbursement claims for business related expenses such as: overnight stays, business dining, and similar expenditures concerning business related activities. Our proposed application offers a uniform and easy solution to track expenses that are classified as business related purchases, made by FDM employees, which will then be authorised prior to proceeding with the reimbursement. 
Additionally, the option to attach VAT and receipts will be in place, providing useful insights aimed at monitoring employeesâ€™ spending patterns and habits by analysing their expenses claims.
